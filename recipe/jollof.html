    <h3>WHAT IS JOLLOF??</h3>
    <P>Jollof Rice is a popular spiced rice and tomato-based West African dish.

        It is also the source of a controversial, yet peaceful conflict lovingly called The Jollof Wars. The long-standing rivalry among West African nations is rooted in one seemingly simple question: Which country makes the best Jollof rice? Every nation, of course, claims to have the best version of this delicately spiced mealtime favorite. At first glance, most preparations of Jollof rice look quite similar: fluffy, confidently bright red rice and placed boldly in the center of a plate or buffer table. But each country is known for its own style—slight variations in the recipe that makes it unique.</P>
